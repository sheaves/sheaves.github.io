## Liang Ze Wong, PhD <img align="right" src="/images/photo.jpg" width="150" />

I am a mathematician, machine learning research scientist, computational social scientist, data scientist, and full-stack programmer.

From 2019 - 2024, I was a research scientist at the [Institute of High Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc){:target="_blank"} in Singapore, working primarily on using natural language processing (NLP) for social media analytics, stance detection, and topic modelling. 

In Fall 2022 and 2023, I also taught the [Foundations of Business Analytics](https://nusmods.com/modules/DBA5106/foundation-in-business-analytics){:target="_blank"} core course for Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) students as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the [NUS Business School](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

I left IHPC at the end of 2024 to spend more time on AI/NLP/LLM research. Since the start of 2025, I have written the following short papers:
- [Paying attention to facts: quantifying the knowledge capacity of attention layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05076){:target="_blank"}
- 'Generalization is hallucination' through the lens of tensor completions

I am currently **open to work** and am seeking research scientist positions in interpretability, alignment and theory of language models.

### Education and Employment History
- 2019 - 2024: Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore
- 2014 - 2019: PhD in Mathematics, University of Washington, Seattle
- 2012 - 2014: Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore
- 2009 - 2012: BA in Mathematics, Cornell University

My graduate and undergraduate studies were funded by the [A*STAR National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-undergraduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-bs). 

## Computational Social Science and NLP research
At IHPC, I worked with an interdisciplinary group of social scientists, psychologists and engineers led by [Dr. Joe Simons](https://sites.google.com/view/joe-simons/).

### Workshops and Talks
- *Applications of LLMs in Social Sciences*, [AI Wednesdays](https://go.gov.sg/aiweds) (Government-wide Community of Practice for Artificial Intelligence), Singapore (October 2024)
- *An Introductory Workshop on using LLMs in Social Science*. [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)](https://sicss.io/2024/singapore/), Singapore (June 2024).

## Mathematics research
I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Washington, Seattle. My advisor was [James Zhang](https://www.math.washington.edu/~zhang/){:target="_blank"}. 

My mathematical research interests are in category theory, homotopy theory, and non-commutative algebra.
Specifically: Grothendieck fibrations, enriched category theory, Hopf algebras and cubical sets.
