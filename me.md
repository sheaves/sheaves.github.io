## Liang Ze Wong <img align="right" src="/images/photo.jpg" width="150" />

I recently graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Washington, Seattle. My advisor was [James Zhang](https://www.math.washington.edu/~zhang/){:target="_blank"}.
Starting Fall 2019, I will be a research scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing in Singapore.

My research interests are in category theory, homotopy type theory, and non-commutative algebra.
Specifically, I am interested in Grothendieck fibrations, enriched category theory, Hopf algebras and cubical sets. 

I used to write simple snippets of code for this site, mostly in Python/Sage.
