Senior Member IEEE","Less than half of the global population is digitally connected. Rest of the three billion populations (O3B) has no connectivity due to poor infrastructure, poverty or unaffordability. On the other hand, developed countries are moving towards smart cities to solve urbanization issues. IoT is a key enabler for smart cities and it is expected to have 50 billion IoT devices by 2020. The requirement on wireless connectivity is ever increasing that results in spectrum crunch.\n\nWhen we look at spectrum usage, although the spectrum is fully allocated, it is only 5-15% utilized from location to location and time to time, based on many studies conducted all over the world. This calls for a need to use next-generation technologies to use spectrum in an innovative manner in order to ensure sustainability. TV White Space (TVWS) is the first technology that uses spectrum dynamically. It is able to find pockets of unused spectrum dynamically and utilize them for communication. Thus, significantly improve spectrum utilization. TVWS is also known as Super Wi-Fi as it covers much larger range than Wi-Fi.\n\nWe developed high data rate products (WhizRange &amp; WhizMesh) for broadband connectivity in unconnected area and low data rate communication module (WhizNano) for sensor networks for the development of thousands of smart cities worldwide and Singapore as smart nation. Through our partners, we deployed our designed TVWS solutions in Singapore and other parts of Asia Pacific region.  We carried out PoC's in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, India &amp; Myanmar.
