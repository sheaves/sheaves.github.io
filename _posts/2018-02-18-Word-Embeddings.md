*Disclaimer: Everything I know about word embeddings come from a couple of blog posts mentioned below, so this article should not be taken too seriously. On the other hand, if this post leads to an actual paper, it would be nice if you mentioned that you first saw it here :D*

This post explores the question: can we extract a fibered category (or a database) from a word space embedding?
